# Alix Refactoring and Optimization Plan

## 1. Component Structure Optimization

### a) Create a Common Components Directory
- Move reusable components like `NFTCard.js` and `ListViewItem.js` to a `src/components/common/` directory.
- This will reduce duplication and make it easier to maintain consistent UI elements.

### b) Implement Lazy Loading
- Use React.lazy() and Suspense for components that aren't immediately necessary, like `CatalogViewPage.js`.
- This will reduce the initial bundle size and improve load times.

## 2. State Management Refactoring

### a) Implement Context API or Redux
- Move global state (like wallets and NFTs) out of `App.js` into a centralized state management solution.
- This will simplify prop drilling and make state updates more predictable.

### b) Use Custom Hooks
- Create custom hooks for common logic, such as wallet connections or NFT fetching.
- This will improve code reusability and separation of concerns.

## 3. Code Splitting and Dynamic Imports

- Implement code splitting for larger components like `CatalogPage.js` and `WalletManager.js`.
- Use dynamic imports to load less critical parts of the application on demand.

## 4. Styling Optimization

### a) Extract Chakra UI Theme
- Move the Chakra UI theme configuration from `styles.js` to a separate `theme` directory.
- This will centralize styling decisions and make it easier to maintain a consistent look.

### b) Implement CSS-in-JS or CSS Modules
- Consider using styled-components or CSS Modules for component-specific styles.
- This will help prevent style conflicts and improve style encapsulation.

## 5. Utility Function Optimization

- Review and refactor `web3Utils.js` to ensure all functions are necessary and optimized.
- Consider splitting into smaller, more focused utility files if it grows too large.

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement a centralized error handling mechanism.
- Add proper error logging for better debugging and monitoring.

## 7. Testing Implementation

- Set up a testing framework (Jest and React Testing Library).
- Start writing unit tests for critical components and utility functions.

## 8. Performance Optimization

- Implement memoization for expensive computations using `useMemo` and `useCallback`.
- Use virtualization for long lists (like in `NFTGrid.js`) to improve rendering performance.

## 9. Code Quality Tools

- Set up ESLint and Prettier for consistent code styling.
- Implement pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before commits.

## 10. Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments to functions and components for better code understanding.
- Update the README with more detailed setup instructions and contribution guidelines.

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize these refactoring tasks based on current project needs.
2. Create issues in the project management tool for each major refactoring task.
3. Implement changes incrementally, ensuring thorough testing after each refactor.
4. Regular code reviews to maintain code quality and consistency.
