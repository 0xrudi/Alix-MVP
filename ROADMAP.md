2. Develop community-driven content curation systems
3. Create incentive structures for active platform contributors

## Ongoing Tasks

1. Regular security audits and updates
2. User feedback collection and feature prioritization
3. Performance optimization and bug fixes
4. Documentation updates and API maintenance for developers

This roadmap is designed to be flexible and can be adjusted based on user feedback, technological advancements, and shifting priorities in the web3 space. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring that core functionalities are in place before moving on to more advanced features.

The modular approach allows for parallel development of certain features and easier project management. It also facilitates easier testing and deployment of individual components.

Remember to regularly reassess and adjust the roadmap based on user needs, technological changes, and project goals. Continuous integration and deployment practices should be implemented to ensure steady progress and frequent updates to the platform.






Based on our current progress and the components we've developed so far, I would estimate our project to be in the early stages of Phase 1. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

Module 1: Core Infrastructure
- Set up React project structure ✅
- Implement basic routing ✅
- Set up state management (Currently using React hooks, might need to transition to Redux or Context API for more complex state management)
- Integrate Chakra UI for consistent styling ✅

Module 2: Wallet Integration
- Implement wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect) ✅ (Basic implementation)
- Develop wallet management interface ✅ (Basic implementation)
- Integrate ENS resolution ✅ (Basic implementation)
- Implement basic transaction history viewing ❌ (Not yet implemented)

Module 3: Basic NFT Viewing
- Integrate with Alchemy API for NFT data fetching ✅ (Basic implementation)
- Develop basic NFT gallery view ✅ (Basic implementation)
- Implement NFT metadata display ✅ (Basic implementation)

Based on this assessment, I would say we are approximately here:

1. We have completed most of Module 1, with the potential need to enhance our state management approach as the application grows more complex.

2. We have made significant progress in Module 2, with basic wallet integration and ENS resolution in place. However, we still need to implement transaction history viewing and potentially enhance the existing wallet management features.

3. We have also made good progress in Module 3, with basic NFT viewing capabilities implemented. There's room for improvement in terms of the gallery view and metadata display.

Overall, I would estimate that we are about 60-70% through Phase 1. The next steps would be to:

1. Finish any remaining tasks in Modules 1-3.
2. Enhance the existing implementations, particularly in wallet management and NFT viewing.
3. Begin planning for Phase 2, which involves content integration from various web3 platforms.

It's important to note that while we've made good progress, there might be a need to revisit and refine some of the implemented features as we move forward, especially as we start integrating more complex functionality in the later phases.
